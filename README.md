# Cat App 🐱

This is a simple web application that allows users to:
- Fetch random **cat facts** (up to 50 at a time)
- View random **cat photos** (up to 10 at a time)

It uses the [MeowFacts API](https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/) and [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) to retrieve data and display it dynamically using JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features
- Clean and responsive UI
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Input validation and error handling
- Uses **Axios** for making API requests

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Axios (via CDN)
- Font Awesome (for spinner icon)

## 📦 How to Use
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Enter the number of facts or photos you want (limit: 1–50 facts, 1–10 photos).
3. Click the corresponding button to fetch data.

## 📌Notes
- Ensure you have an internet connection to access the external APIs and CDN libraries.
- The project gracefully handles invalid input and failed API requests.
